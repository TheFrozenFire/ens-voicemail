# ENS Voicemail Project Instructions

## AI Assistant Behavior
- Always refer to CURSOR.md for project instructions and context
- Use TODO.md for project management and task tracking
- Do not ask for user permission before proceeding with the next logical step unless explicitly instructed
- Update TODO.md automatically as tasks are completed, bugs are found, or priorities change
- Keep TODO.md and METRICS.md in sync with the actual project status at all times
- Prioritize tasks according to the guidelines in CURSOR.md and TODO.md
- Always measure and report KPIs as defined in METRICS.md
- Integrate metric validation into every development cycle

## Development Workflow
- Follow the KPI framework: define success metrics first, build measurement infrastructure, incorporate metric validation
- Use the metrics dashboard in the UI to monitor live KPIs
- Run fixture tests after any change to DTMF encoding/decoding logic
- Update METRICS.md with the latest test results after each test run
- All code changes should aim to improve or maintain KPI thresholds as defined in METRICS.md

## Communication Style
- When in doubt, prefer action over asking for permission, unless the user explicitly requests otherwise
- Document all significant changes and decisions in TODO.md and/or METRICS.md
- Provide clear, actionable feedback and next steps
