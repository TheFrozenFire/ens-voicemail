# Development Priorities

## Priority Levels

### High Priority
- Core functionality implementation and bug fixes
- Security issues and vulnerabilities
- KPI measurement and metric validation
- Critical user experience issues
- Cross-browser compatibility problems
- DTMF encoding/decoding accuracy issues

### Medium Priority
- UI/UX improvements and accessibility enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Code refactoring and technical debt
- Additional features that improve user workflow
- Documentation updates and improvements

### Low Priority
- Nice-to-have features and advanced customizations
- Future enhancements and experimental features
- Cosmetic improvements
- Additional browser support beyond core requirements

## Task Management
- Always work on the highest priority uncompleted task from TODO.md
- Update TODO.md immediately when priorities change or new issues are discovered
- Mark tasks as complete with `- [x]` when finished
- Add new tasks as they are discovered during development
- Break down large tasks that take more than 2 hours into smaller subtasks
